Apparently, the course is so difficult that the professor having the course, has not even passed the exam. That information was not given beforehand.	No	Too high	Too high	Too high	Too high	I don't know the professors gender, but he/she is extremely selfish and won't share any information about the course or exam beforehand. He..I mean..she..I mean, the professor (which we have never met or seen or heard, therefore the uncertain understanding of the professors gender) has not even completed the exam him/herself, so the exam was not made. Therefore, it was very hard to answer the tasks given on the exam. I got an F, and complained on the grade, which was later adjusted to an A. Apparently, that sucks, because now I've been chosen to be the professor, since the old one has retired. I'm a male btw.	The backboard is to slippery, the markers ink just flows down the board, impossible to write with, except if you like the matrix wallpaper, except in black, red or blue. Green was not available. And there's no number on it, the ink is just ink.	I terminated the computer by accident, so now we can't use it. We tried oracle service, but they made changes in Java, so now we can't use it. Darn.	There were none assignments, but they was extremely complex to answer. I mean, that's criticism right there.	My fellow students. We made a bucket and hashed tears into it.  It was nice.	Yeah, the feedback is pretty bad. I mean, you could at least turn the mic away from the speakers, so this doesn't happen so often. I can't go to school with hearing protectors every day. I get sore around my ears.	Yes	Phukebab Nordemans	Exceptionally great performance in class. Never seen him. But exceptionally great.	No
